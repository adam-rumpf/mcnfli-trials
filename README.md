# MCNFLI Computational Trials

This is a set of programs used for generating and evaluating computational trials in one of my research projects related to the minimum-cost network flows problem with linear interdependencies (MCNFLI). The computational trials consist of generating random test networks and solving them using several different methods to compare the results. It includes a modified version of NETGEN for generating random network instances, which is based on a C implementation by Norbert Schlenker (license included in source code).

I would not expect these to be useful for anyone outside of my research group, but they are provided here in case anyone is interested.
